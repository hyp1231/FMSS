# FMSS

A simulation of Unix's file management system.

Developed by "Prime Luo" and his buddy "Yupeng Hou"

## Quick Start

The system uses a file named "diskdata" to simulate a disk.

So we need to generate this file firstly.

`make gen`

`./gen`

And then you have this file, so you can run the system!

`make`

`./main`

If you need help about how to use it, just input "help" to get what you need.

Have a good time~ :)
